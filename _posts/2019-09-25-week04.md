### Git Activity and Open Source Contributions Revisited

It's one thing to read or hear about what Git is used for, but it was something else entirely to see it play out in front of me. As I was wrapping up the last steps of the activity, I was already thinking about how I could use this tool for myself (writing flash card files on my desktop with a full-sized keyboard and synchronizing card and stat changes between it and my phone for starters). But yes, I'd say it was incredibly useful.

As with anything you start out learning, it has the potential to be confusing. But I think the worry of messing up and ruining someone else's work was the bigger reason for working through each step as slowly as I did. Still, each step completed came with a feeling similar to the one I recall when first learning to program.

I didn't get to finish because I needed steps outside of my assigned tasks to be completed first, but it was great to see that pull request not come back empty-handed the last time I tried it. It was like finally getting a package I was really looking forward to. I know these are all baby steps, but there's something about this kind of coordination that I can't help but smile about. I can only imagine what it will feel like to have something meaningful come together and have a small part of it be because of me.

Because of the timing of when all our parts came together, I avoided dealing with merge conflicts this time around. Everything worked out fine for the most part. And thanks to our fourth member, I found a new song I like.

The on-line readings included the very important topic of preparing yourself for making non-trivial contributions. I remember from reading on forums the importance of looking for answers to your questions first before posting them, so it was not surprising to see that come up. One thing stood out the most for me though.

The way one of the authors was able to get the guidance needed to grow their confidence was so reassuring. More experienced people are using relatively simpler problems as a learning opportunity for those of us wanting to get started in contributing to open source. They see this process as a worthwhile investment. There are people out there, complete strangers, that want you to grow and succeed.
