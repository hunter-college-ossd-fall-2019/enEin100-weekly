### Open Source Software Development. Why?

While looking at the list of available courses for the Fall 2019 semester, I thought that it would be nice to choose something that aligned with my interests or even just curiosity. Maybe it would be easier if it did, but probably not. What I really wanted, if possible, was to leave with a greater understanding of something that I already interact with or care about. When I saw _Open Source Software Development_ was available, I knew I had to see about it.

I've been interested enough in open source software to at least look at the code of a particular project I wanted to know more about (was so *very* lost). But long before that and even to this day, I come across terms like _repo_, _pull request_, _git_, _fork_, and I wouldn't be able to tell you much more than what I've gathered from context. So if I have to learn something, why not this? And who knows, maybe taking this course will lead to me giving back to projects that I have used and really care about.
