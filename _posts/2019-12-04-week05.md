### Finding a Project, git and GitHub Progress

Looking through the recommendation links to help me find a project to which I could contribute, I found that people really go out of their way to help would-be contributors choose a good starting point. There are all sorts of useful labels or tags on issues which identify them as good candidates for first attempts. One site even let you search by programming language in addition to that. A couple of them offered to notify you when such issues are created. 

Luckily, I came across one project by chance a long while back on an online forum and going through those sites reminded me of it. I’ve seen the creator talk about it before. It was a free book he has been working on. When I looked him up, I saw he was talking about the things he’s working on for the second edition. I distinctly remember his very positive attitude and responses to everyone who offered suggestions. I searched the title of the book and came across the repository on GitHub. This was perfect. 

I didn’t have the time to read the whole thing, so I jumped to the glossary to see if I could find any easy fixes that other contributors may have missed. I found not one, but three simple changes. After being made aware by my professor that this level of corrections doesn’t require creating an issue first, I forked the repository and got started. For future reference, if you think you could ask twenty people how something should be fixed and they’d all say the same thing, it’s safe to skip the issue creation and go right to the pull request. 

Before pulling the trigger, I looked at current issues to see if someone was working on the same things as me. The coast was clear on that end. I remembered to create the pull request from the right location on the first go (only took me three attempts to remember). I did one commit per change because that seems to make comparing changes easier. I hit submit and later in the day I see the emails: “Good Job! Thank you.” and “Merged #74 into master”! 

And there you go! A book about a project I am very interested in accepted my changes. I didn’t do much, but it still feels great. I ended up explaining to two friends what open source is about so they could understand the accomplishment I wanted to share with them. One person in one of the pages about making first contributions described how just one contribution led to many more over the years. I totally understand how he felt. 

This past week was the heaviest one so far in terms of information. I learned enough of the basics to be able to fork a project, set the upstream remote, and create/solve issues and pull requests. And I have Merge #74 as proof. The group activity was tougher than the first (even with the team sitting together), but things are coming along nicely I think. Just waiting for a pull request of mine to be accepted and my created issue to be closed. As long as I can apply what I'm learning, I'm sure it'll stick.
